## Hobbies
### Photography


Away from the world of code, I wield a DSLR to capture moments that unfold around me. Photography is not just a hobby; it's a way for me to pause, observe, and appreciate the world's intricate details. From cityscapes to nature's wonders, I love freezing these moments in time, telling stories through my lens.

### Sports and Expedition

Beyond the screen, I am an avid explorer and sports enthusiast. I love chasing the wind on bike rides, conquering peaks on treks, and immersing myself in the camaraderie of football, badminton, and swimming. I also love going on trails and jogs which is not just a fitness routine; it's a journey to discover new paths and perspectives.
